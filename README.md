# UART
A basic UART module design using systemverilog which sends 8 bit data from a master transmitter to a slave receiver.
Currently does not include baud rate in the transmitter side.
Receiver side has baud rate of 115.2kBps.
Testbench written for transmitter and receiver separately.
Baud rate for transmitter added.
Designed a complete UART module.


Future Exapansion:

Add Error detection system : Parity bit

Testbench for the complete UART module.
